My final project will include three scenarios: one positive, one standard, and one ultimately, one that will seriously injure the passenger. The project will take place in a subway station, and the there will be a function that will allow the viewer to open and close the door. The keyboard will be the tool utilized for the opening and the closing of the door. There will be images attached to variable to include the different scenarios. I will be running a loop for the randomization of situations. I believe utilizing the sound library on p5js will add the perfect element of illustrating the subway experience.

Code Plan PT2: I realized that using the p5play library made the most sense in terms of showcasing my assets. After much deliberation with gifs and jpegs, this seemed like the most succesful approach. Instead of randomization, I opted for specification of scenarios per ticket chosen. Because the project is so graphic heavy, I believed relieving it of sound made it more cohesive and allowed the viewer to focus on the experience instead.
